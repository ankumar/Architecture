# Perspective & Context

[As a strategy formulation, we are trying to change a situation A into a better situation B. This process might end in the real world, but it starts in our imaginations, in the virtual world](https://info.container-solutions.com/patterns-maps). This is an exploration of synthesizing perspectives from Business to Infrastructure & Code of such a virtual world in the context of new generation of Sensors, Edge, 5G Rollout & Cloud to aid in decision making for design, develop, and deploy model of Business Applications backed by an Cloud Platform.

## Technology & Business

Using Amazon.com, Inc. as an example technology tranforming businesses starting with a recent thread on Twitter...

**"Hi Werner, I was wondering... what advice would you offer to somebody who'd like to be a CTO someday? Especially for the younger folks, what should one know or how should one prepare themselves for their future? Appreciate you taking the time to read this.**

**in one tweet? 1) if you want to be a VP of Engineering focus on teams and people and how to make them succesfull 2) wanna be a CTO? Simplify.  Focus on the business, what is the simplest, most robust Tech/Ops that makes the business succeed."**

> Context matters, even the effective implementation of doctrine requires you to understand context i.e. focus on user needs (universal) varies with implementation (i.e. what needs to focus on)

## Tools & Services - Great Apps come from developers using tools they love, getting value from the product in seconds leading to greater reuse and wider adoption.

> Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another’s mistakes rather than building on one another’s successes.
