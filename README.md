**"Hi Werner, I was wondering... what advice would you offer to somebody who'd like to be a CTO someday? Especially for the younger folks, what should one know or how should one prepare themselves for their future? Appreciate you taking the time to read this.**

**in one tweet? 1) if you want to be a VP of Engineering focus on teams and people and how to make them succesfull 2) wanna be a CTO? Simplify.  Focus on the business, what is the simplest, most robust Tech/Ops that makes the business succeed."**

## 2. Tools & Experiences

Platform is a perspective, Serving customers ... **"Platform” with a standardized interface allowing decentralized development. Programs built with it are “continually valid and observable from the very beginning of its construction”.**
