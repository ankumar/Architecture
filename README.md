Hi Werner, I was wondering... what advice would you offer to somebody who'd like to be a CTO someday? Especially for the younger folks, what should one know or how should one prepare themselves for their future? Appreciate you taking the time to read this.

in one tweet? 1) if you want to be a VP of Engineering focus on teams and people and how to make them succesfull 2) wanna be a CTO? Simplify.  Focus on the business, what is the simplest, most robust Tech/Ops that makes the business succeed.

## > 1. Devs to focus on Business logic, Hiding Distributed systems complexity
**There isn't a concrete, well-defined algorithm for [decomposing](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/05/on-the-criteria-to-be-used-in-decomposing-systems-into-modules/) a system into services. As with much of software development, it's something of an art. If you decompose a system incorrectly, we have a distributed monolith, a system consisting of coupled services that must be deployed together. A distributed monolith has the drawbacks of both the monolithic and the Microservices architectures.** <br/>
