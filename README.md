## 1. Technology & Business

This project started with this Twitter https://twitter.com/Werner/status/1169979140784525312 thread.

**"Hi Werner, I was wondering... what advice would you offer to somebody who'd like to be a CTO someday? Especially for the younger folks, what should one know or how should one prepare themselves for their future? Appreciate you taking the time to read this.**

**in one tweet? 1) if you want to be a VP of Engineering focus on teams and people and how to make them succesfull 2) wanna be a CTO? Simplify.  Focus on the business, what is the simplest, most robust Tech/Ops that makes the business succeed."**

 I shared this internally to select teams within the company & was quite surprised with People at every level relating, liking & reacting to this exchange. This literally started the journey around take-aways in the exchange.

1. Framing & Asking the right question.
2. Finding the right Answer is **Process, Perspectives, Wisdom & Sharing**, especially shared Generosity from the Tech community.

**Universally useful patterns:**
**"Context matters, even the effective implementation of doctrine requires you to understand context i.e. focus on user needs (universal) varies with implementation (i.e. what needs to focus on)"**
