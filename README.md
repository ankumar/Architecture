Imagine a **continuous delivery experience** like this repo where we don't think of Servers, Deployment, Track & version changes from Code to Configuration, Infrastructure (as Code), Unified workflows for Code & [Data](https://accelst.com/the-quest-for-the-holy-grail-of-git-for-data/).

As a strategy formulation, we are trying to change a situation A into a better situation B. This process might end in the real world, but it starts in our imaginations, in the virtual world. This is an exploration of synthesizing perspectives from Business to Infrastructure & Code of such a virtual world in the context of new generation of Sensors, Edge, 5G Rollout & Cloud to aid in decision making for design, develop, and deploy model of Business Applications backed by an Cloud Platform. The proposal is aligned with Design Heuristics, will be refined over time after feedback & deeper understanding of real world.

## 1. Technology & Business

Using Amazon.com, Inc. as an example starting with a recent thread on Twitter...

**"Hi Werner, I was wondering... what advice would you offer to somebody who'd like to be a CTO someday? Especially for the younger folks, what should one know or how should one prepare themselves for their future? Appreciate you taking the time to read this.**

**in one tweet? 1) if you want to be a VP of Engineering focus on teams and people and how to make them succesfull 2) wanna be a CTO? Simplify.  Focus on the business, what is the simplest, most robust Tech/Ops that makes the business succeed."**

2. [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)

> Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another’s mistakes rather than building on one another’s successes.
