Hi Werner, I was wondering... what advice would you offer to somebody who'd like to be a CTO someday? Especially for the younger folks, what should one know or how should one prepare themselves for their future? Appreciate you taking the time to read this.

in one tweet? 1) if you want to be a VP of Engineering focus on teams and people and how to make them succesfull 2) wanna be a CTO? Simplify.  Focus on the business, what is the simplest, most robust Tech/Ops that makes the business succeed.

## Platform is a perspective, Serving customers 
- "Platform” with a standardized interface allowing decentralized development.
- Programs built with it are “continually valid and observable from the very beginning of its construction”.
