Research has found that successful leaders share three behavioral traits: they lead by example, admit their mistakes, and see positive qualities in others. All three are linked to spaces of play. Leading by example creates a space that is trusted—and without trust, there is no play. Admitting mistakes is to celebrate uncertainty. Seeing qualities in others is to encourage diversity.

## Well Architected
Enterprise architecture is about High-level strategic stuff including People, Process and Technology; synthesis of multiple perspectives, including social dynamics, domain-driven design, business models, and software architecture. It's not about code, and it's not a synonym for "software architecture".

* Anti-Architecture
  * A [big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/) is a software system that lacks a perceivable architecture. Although undesirable from a software engineering point of view, such systems are common in practice due to business pressures, developer turnover and code entropy. They are a type of design anti-pattern.
