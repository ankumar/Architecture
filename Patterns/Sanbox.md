# Experimentation, sharing & collaborating

[Open Application Model (OAM)](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec) is a specification for building cloud native applications. OAM aims to enable the [separation of concerns](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/blob/d16d5add/introduction.md) between application developers, application operators, and infrastructure operators. [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) is an open source multicloud control plane that shares many of OAM's goals around enabling the separation of concerns when modelling cloud native applications.
