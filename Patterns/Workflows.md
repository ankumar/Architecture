* [Determined: The Open Source Deep Learning Training Platform](https://determined.ai/developers/)

The goal of the platform is to enable Deep Learning Engineers to focus more of their time and energy on their ultimate goal â€” training high-quality models. They achieve this by tightly integrating all of the functionality DL Engineers need to train models at scale, including:
- High-performance distributed training that just works
- State-of-the-art hyperparameter search
- Experiment management with experiment tracking, log management, metrics visualization, reproducibility, and dependency management
- Flexibility - a fully open source system that supports both Tensorflow and PyTorch, and can run in the cloud or on-prem
