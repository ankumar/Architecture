* 1990: The world wide web was released out of CERN, thank you Tim Berners-Lee! Originally it only ran on NeXT computers!
* 1991: Apple's PowerBook laptops, with built-in trackball, are released.
* 1993: Windows NT is released.
* 1994: Zip drives are released from Iomega, allowing 100MB to be stored on a single Zip Disk.
* 1995 and later: The big browser war between Netscape and Microsoft.
* 1997: The CD-RW is introduced.
* 1998: The colorful iMacs are launched.

# 80s

# 70s

# 60s

* 1960: COBOL is developed by the Pentagon and a few computer manufacturers. The DEC PDP-1 is introduced. It cost about $120,000.
* 1961: IBM introduced the 1400 series. There is still a working one in the Computer History Museum today! Timesharing systems start to become super popular.
* 1962: Sperry Rand developed thin-film memory which is a faster variation of core memory.
* 1963: The first edition of the ASCII standard is published.
* 1964: DEC's PDP-8 is introduced. IBM announced the System/360. Teletype introduced the ASR-33 terminal, which sold for around $700.
* 1965: The Olivetti Programma 101 is released. NASA used some of these calculators on the Apollo space project.
* 1966: ELIZA the natural language processing environment used for the psychotherapist chatbot "DOCTOR", which you can still use in emacs, is completed.
* 1968: Edsger Dijkstra published his letter: "GO TO statement considered harmful" in Communications of the ACM. The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) is debuted. The IBM "Minnow" floppy disk drive, which was the floppy disk drive, began development. The mother of all demos takes place in San Francisco.
* 1969: Apollo Guidance Computer read-only rope memory is launched into space with Apollo 11. UNIX is developed.

# 50s

* 1950: Magnetic drum memory is developed for the US Navy.
* 1951: The first Univac 1 is delivered to the US Census Bureau. Univac introduced the UNISERVO tape drive for the Univac 1. It was the first tape storage for a commercial computer. Alan Turing created the Turing Test.
* 1952: On November 4th, the Univac computer predicted the outcome of the election.
* 1953: Whirlwind core memory is developed at MIT. It was the first computer to use magnetic core memory.
* 1954: IBM introduced the 650 magnetic drum calculator.
* 1956: The first implementations of keyboards are developed at MIT. An early experiment was named a Flexowriter. IBM shipped the RAMAC computer with magnetic disk storage.
* 1957: DEC was founded. FORTRAN is developed at IBM.
* 1958: LISP is invented by John McCarthy at MIT.
