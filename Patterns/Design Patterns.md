There isn't a concrete, well-defined algorithm for [decomposing](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/05/on-the-criteria-to-be-used-in-decomposing-systems-into-modules/) [a system](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3395214) into [services](Modeling.md). As with much of software development, it's something of an art. If you decompose a system incorrectly, we have a distributed monolith, a system consisting of coupled services that must be deployed together. A distributed monolith has the drawbacks of both the monolithic and the Microservices architectures.
