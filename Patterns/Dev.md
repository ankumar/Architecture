 # Anti-patterns:
* A [big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/) is a software system that lacks a perceivable architecture. Although undesirable from a software engineering point of view, such systems are common in practice due to business pressures, developer turnover and code entropy. They are a type of design anti-pattern.

# Cloud Computing:
| **Characteristics** | **Developer Productivity** |
|------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-demand self-service** | A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction |
|**Broad network access**|Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms|
|**Resource pooling**|The providerâ€™s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically|
|**Rapid elasticity**|Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward with demand|
|**Measured service**|Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability (typically per-per-use)|
