## Virtual Machines
* BEAM (Elixir/Erlang) - http://ds.cs.ut.ee/courses/course-files/To303nis%20Pool%20.pdf 
  * BEAM is the virtual machine at the core of the Erlang Open Telecom Platform (OTP)
  * Actor model, Actor model on the JVM is called Akka

* Firecracker offers the best of both worlds: the security of hardware-virtualization-based virtual machines and the resource efficiency and fast startup time of containers. Firecracker has been deployed in two publicly available serverless computer services within AWS (Lambda and Fargate), where it supports millions of production workloads, and trillions of requests each month.
