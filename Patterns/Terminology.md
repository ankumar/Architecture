* [**Conway's Law**](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html) - How to Organize Organization for Optimal Development / "Shipping the Org Chart",  Pay the cost later in internal tools & stitching data together
* **Cloud Native** - Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. **Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs** exemplify this approach. These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

* Inner Source - Global & Local dichotomy, Open source best practices within organization
* Cell-Based Architecture - System Availability & Minimize the "blast radius" of any failures
