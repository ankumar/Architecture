**Go** 

- https://golang.org/ 
- No header files, made up of packages
- Programs start running in package main
- func main() { } - Takes no arguments
- 
- type comes after the variable name, x int, y int
- basic types: bool string int int8 int16 int32 int64
- uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr
- byte // alias for uint8
- rune // alias for int32
- float32 float64
- complex64 complex128
- Arrays, Maps
- A struct is a collection of fields
- Type inference
- Go has pointers / Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic
- Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types.
- if, else, switch, for (NO while) & defer - No parentheses, but braces { } are required. If - before condition
- Concurrency - Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example), https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoConcurrencyStillNotEasy

"Until now, we have had three such language features that let programmers create their own Words of Power by (a) giving a user-defined name to (b) something whose implementation is hidden. They are: the variable (which encapsulates the current value), the function (which encapsulates code and behavior), and the class (which encapsulates both to deliver a bunch of state and functions together)"
