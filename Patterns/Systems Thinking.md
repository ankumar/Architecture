# Systems Thinking: Resilience is having companies of all sizes Small, Medium & Large, more in each not few ....

## 1. SYSTEMS THINKING - Large Scale Macro Environment, Technology/Processes/People
## 2. FUTURE - Opportunities & Patterns, NOT discrete Issues or Events
## 3. ENGAGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME - Collective highly targeted unit, Shared View
  
## Architecture is about **Systems Thinking** including People, Process and Technology; synthesis of multiple perspectives, including social dynamics, domain-driven design, business models, and software architecture. It's not about code, and it's not a synonym for "software architecture"

## <p align="center"><b>"If we have a system of improvement that’s directed at improving the parts taken separately, you can be absolutely sure that the performance of the whole will not be improved. The performance of a system depends on how the parts fit, not how they act taken separately.” <b>- Dr. Russell Ackoff.</b></p>
# System:
**1. A system is a whole that is defined by its function(s) in one or more containing systems.** <br>
**2. Every system contains at least two essential parts and these must satisfy three conditions.**
  * Every essential part of a system can affect its behavior or properties.
  * The way an essential part affects the properties or behavior of the whole depends on the
   state or activity of at least one other part of the system.
  * Groups of essential parts, subsystems, also can affect the behavior and properties of the whole system and none has an independent effect on it.

Some important properties of a system derive from its definition.
  * When a system is taken apart it loses its essential properties.
  * No part of a system can carry out the function that defines the system.
  * When a system is taken apart its essential parts lose their ability to carry out the
   function they have in the whole.

**Finally: When the performance of any essential part of a system, taken separately, is improved, the performance of the whole may not be.**

## Enterprise:

"Anything is possible for a company when its culture is about listening, learning, and harnessing individual passions and talents to the company’s mission." - Satya Nadella

"One of the biggest tragedies in modern organisation design is the separation of tech and business. A big part of the role of technical leader and architect is to break down these barriers" - Martin Fowler, O’Reilly Software Arhitecture Conference

"Changing technology is (comparatively) easy compared to changing culture" / "Culture needs to change as our tech approaches change, but we’ve got to be patient, empathetic and realistic "
## 1. **Legacy:** "it makes actual money"
## 2. **Architecture:** Greenfield & Brownfield, Systems and Data
## 3. **Cloud:** **Cost Effective Scheduling, Data Gravity**

#### <p align="center"> <b> "enterprises buy everything. If you're big enough and you have a big enough IT budget, most enterprises have a POC of everything that's for sale, period. There's some team in some pocket, maybe they came through via acquisition. Maybe they live in a different state. Maybe it's just a new project that came out. And what you tend to see, at least from my experiences, if I walk into a typical enterprise, they may tell me something like, "Hey, we have a POC, a Pivotal Cloud Foundry, OpenShift, and we want some of that new thing that we just saw from you guys. How do we get a POC going?" </b> </p> [- Kelsey Hightower, principal developer advocate at Google](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/the-staying-power-of-kubernetes-with-kelsey-hightower/)
## **1. Technology needs to be embedded in the Business not external to it or merely aligned with it**
         - Work backwards from Customer/Business outcomes
         - Build closed loop systems to optimize for continual Improvements & Learning
         - Technology Commoditization
## **2. Focus on core value vs plumbing:**
         - Business mapped into technologies that underpin the delivery of that core value 
         - Seeing Custom & Commodity technologies in the value chain
         - Custom to Commodity & Viceversa to increase the value delivery for lower cost

   “One of the biggest tragedies, I feel, in much of the software world, is how we divorce ourselves, and organizations create barriers between the business side, and the technical side, and it's important for an architect, as a technical leader, to go out, and try and break down those barriers …”

## Sometimes architects wonder how they get attention up in the "penthouse". This is it - leadership is starved for meaningful, neutral advice. As an architect neutrality is the most important asset. It provides tremendous value to leadership, they usually don't get unbiased information from anybody else, everybody else has an agenda (usually money) - @ghohpe #OReillySACon #OReillySAConQuotes
