# Masterclass in San Francisco, Dec 9, 2019
- Ruth Malan, Bredemeyer Consulting

**OPTIONAL READING (there are no prerequisites for this masterclass)**

Some background reading that gives a sense of the scope of technical leadership roles:

* Keavy McMinn, “Thriving on the Technical Leadership Path,” https://keavy.com/work/thriving-on-the-technical-leadership-path/
* John Allspaw, "On Being A Senior Engineer,"  https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/
* Charity Majors, “The Engineer/Manager Pendulum, https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/

**Leadership styles vary, and so does guidance.  Here’s an indication of the spread:**

* Turn the Ship Around!, David Marquet
* Becoming a Technical Leader: An Organic Problem-Solving Approach, Gerald Weinberg
* Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim
* The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change, Camille Fournier
* Organizational Culture and Leadership, Edgar H Schein
* The Little Guide to Empathetic Technical Leadership, Alex Harms (new edition coming soon)
* The Mythical Man Month, Fred Brooks
* Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts, Brené Brown
* Resilient Management, Lara Hogan

And because Technical Leadership draws on both the technical and on leadership or organizational and relationship matters, the array of books each of us (with our unique contexts and personal journeys) might find relevant is vast. For example:
 
* Humility: Humble Inquiry: The Gentle Art of Asking Instead of Telling, Edgar H Schein
* Without being harsh on ourselves: Banish Your Inner Critic: Silence the Voice of Self-Doubt to Unleash Your Creativity and Do Your Best Work, Denise Jacobs

A sample of the masterclass material:

Decisions and technical Leadership: https://ruthmalan.com/Journal/2019/20190629SlideDocTechnicalLeadershipDecisions.pdf

**Decisions – individual and group:**

## Perspectives

Interesting set of leadership principles I transcribed during [a podcast](https://jockopodcast.com/2017/08/09/87-how-to-act-as-a-leader-importance-of-the-warrior-culture-and-in-leadership-the-clay-pigeons-of-st-lo/). I loved them and wanted to share them with you all.

David Hackworth on Glover Johns: "He was a leader who taught by example"

Glover Johns leadership principles:

* Strive to do small things well
* Be a doer and a self starter.  Aggressiveness and initiative are two most admired qualities in a leader, but you also must put up your feet and think
* Strive for self improvement through constant self evaluation
* Never be satisfied. Ask if any project, "How can it be done better?"
* Don’t overinspect or oversupervise. Allow your leaders to learn through mistakes in training so they can profit from their errors and not make them in combat
* Keep the troops informed. Telling them what, how, and why will builds their confidence
* The harder the training, the more the troops will brag
* Enthusiasm, fairness, and moral and physical courage: four of the most important aspects of leadership
* Showmanship: a viral technique of leadership
* The ability to speak and write well: two essential tools of leadership
* There is a salient difference between profanity and obscenity. The leader employs profanity tempered with discretion, he never uses obscenities
* Have consideration for others
* Yelling detracts from your dignity. Take your men aside and counsel them
* Understand and use judgment. Know when to stop fighting for something you believe is right. Discuss and argue your point of view until a decision is made, and then support the decision wholeheartedly 
* Stay ahead of your boss
* The source David Hackworth in About Face, who was covering a farewell speech by his idol, Glover Johns.
