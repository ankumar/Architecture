# Masterclass in San Francisco, Dec 9, 2019
- Ruth Malan, Bredemeyer Consulting

**OPTIONAL READING (there are no prerequisites for this masterclass)**

Some background reading that gives a sense of the scope of technical leadership roles:

* Keavy McMinn, “Thriving on the Technical Leadership Path,” https://keavy.com/work/thriving-on-the-technical-leadership-path/
* John Allspaw, "On Being A Senior Engineer,"  https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/
* Charity Majors, “The Engineer/Manager Pendulum, https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/

**Leadership styles vary, and so does guidance.  Here’s an indication of the spread:**

* Turn the Ship Around!, David Marquet
* Becoming a Technical Leader: An Organic Problem-Solving Approach, Gerald Weinberg
* Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim
* The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change, Camille Fournier
* Organizational Culture and Leadership, Edgar H Schein
* The Little Guide to Empathetic Technical Leadership, Alex Harms (new edition coming soon)
* The Mythical Man Month, Fred Brooks
* Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts, Brené Brown
* Resilient Management, Lara Hogan

And because Technical Leadership draws on both the technical and on leadership or organizational and relationship matters, the array of books each of us (with our unique contexts and personal journeys) might find relevant is vast. For example:
 
* Humility: Humble Inquiry: The Gentle Art of Asking Instead of Telling, Edgar H Schein
* Without being harsh on ourselves: Banish Your Inner Critic: Silence the Voice of Self-Doubt to Unleash Your Creativity and Do Your Best Work, Denise Jacobs

**Decisions – individual and group:**

* Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions, Gary Klein
* Cognition in the Wild, Edwin Hutchins
