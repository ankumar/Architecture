* Cloud would not have been possible without open source
* “if you want to go fast go alone, but if you want to go far, go together”. "Feels like it's time to really focus on accelerating the abundance of open source, collaborating to make the pie bigger for all. Abundance, not scarcity. I'm so, so happy to see Elastic doing well, and love this community where we can build together, even when we compete"
* " "new model" is a big increase in end user corporations contributing to and producing their own open source projects. That's where the resources are coming from, and it's part of the success of Netflix, Capital One, Lyft, Airbnb that is spreading.” <p align="right"><b>- Adrian Cockcroft, VP Cloud architecture strategy at Amazon Web Services</b></p>
* Over 1.3 million first time contributors joined the open source community
* Community & Company Driven [Projects](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/)
* Open [Governance](https://github.com/cncf/toc/), Stewardship & [Principles](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/PRINCIPLES.md#toc-operating-principles)
* How much has cloud hurt Elastic? "We haven't seen Open Distro really make any change or difference for us". Lots of good, incl AWS/others contributing to Elasticsearch/Lucene & seemingly no bad. Turns out cloud/open source are force multipliers. -  Shay Banon (CEO)

* InnerSource - Open source best practices within organization
  * [GitHub Whitepaper](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/)
  * [Open source best practices within organization](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns)
  * [Spotify Guilds – Cultivating Knowledge Sharing in Large-scale Agile Organizations](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/3/243029-spotify-guilds/abstract)   “Guilds or Communities of practice (CoPs) are not a new phenomenon. Communities existed in the cave times, when people gathered around a fire to discuss strategies for cornering prey. Communities are cultivated for their potential to influence the knowledge culture and bring value on the individual level (e.g. forum for expanding skills and expertise, strong sense of professional identity), team/project level (e.g. arena for problem solving, quick answers to questions) and company level (e.g. coordination and standardization across units, knowledge-based alliances, increased retention of talent). In large-scale agile organizations, CoPs are recognized for alleviating the inter-team coordination.”
