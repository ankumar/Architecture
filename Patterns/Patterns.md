* Anti-Architecture
  * A [big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/) is a software system that lacks a perceivable architecture. Although undesirable from a software engineering point of view, such systems are common in practice due to business pressures, developer turnover and code entropy. They are a type of design anti-pattern.
