# Design Heuristics

In the context of [Software Is Eating the World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) & [The Future of Software Engineering in the Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K4ljFZWgW8), Many organizations have become adept at identifying what they need from software development projects, based on a keen understanding of their business goals. Even so, they’re often surprised to find out that the end results don’t achieve the transformative impact they were expecting. Their mistake? Overlooking the importance of Conway’s Law.

In 1967, Melvin Conway coined a phrase at the end of his publication [‘How do committees invent?’](http://www.melconway.com/Home/pdf/committees.pdf) that was subsequently made popular by **Fred Brooks** in his book **The Mythical Man-Month**, where he dubbed it 'Conway’s Law', which states **"Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."**

Although this is not a scientific law, it is a valid proposition for many environments. We often see its effects in our workplace and in other companies that develop software.

<p align="center"> <b> No engineering process can replace the philosophy of responsibility. </b> </p> 

<p align="center"> Be mindful of Flow: Dev + Sec + Fin + Ops - Breaking down dependencies, silos, increasing agility, keeping costs under control & the focus on delivering business value. </p>

Businesses across Retail, Finance, Health, Education, Manufacturing & Goverment are Transforming, Modernizing & Updating **Architecture & Technology Stacks** around Cloud Technologies. The architecture is being developed in a vendor neutral & open governance model driven by open source communities under [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) & other [organizations](https://opensource.com/resources/organizations).

[Per Cloud Native Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape), a definition ...

***Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.***

***These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.***

***The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.***

Let's look at some interesting [System design principles](Design%20Patterns.md), Implementations of **Mobile & Web** Applications as **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** designed [Microservices and functions](http://bit.ly/9stepsawesome) & composability spanning multiple requests using **Workflows** & **Integrations**.

A model of abstractions, crisp boundaries, clear separation of concerns, and a balanced set of responsibilities.
