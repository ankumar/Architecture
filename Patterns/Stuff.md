We are changing architecture & technology stacks across all Businesses with a term **Cloud Native**. The current definition from [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/)

*Cloud Native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. **Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.** These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.* 

Let's look at [Design Patterns](Design%20Patterns.md), Implementations as single request/reply API's & compostions spanning multiple requests using **Workflows** & Integrations.
