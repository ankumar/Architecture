# Design Heuristics

Looking Ahead, we are changing architecture & technology stacks across all businesses with a term **Cloud Native**. The current definition from [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) around Cloud Native Technology ...

*Cloud Native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. **Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.** These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.* 

Let's look at some interesting [**Principles**](http://www.poppendieck.com/) & [**Design Patterns**](Design%20Patterns.md), Implementations as **API's** designed as microservices and functions to compostion spanning multiple requests using **Workflows** & **Integrations**.
