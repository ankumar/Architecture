<p align="center"> Dev + Sec + Fin + Ops - Breaking down dependencies, silos, increasing agility, keeping costs under control & the focus on delivering business value. </p>

Businesses across Retail, Finance, Health, Education, Manufacturing & Goverment are Transforming, Modernizing & Updating **Architecture & Technology Stacks** around Cloud Technologies. The architecture is being developed in a vendor neutral & open governance model driven by open source communities under [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) & other [organizations](https://opensource.com/resources/organizations).

[Per Cloud Native Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape), a definition ...

***Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.***

***These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.***

***The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.***

Let's look at some interesting [system design principles](Design%20Patterns.md), Implementations as **API's** designed [microservices and functions](http://bit.ly/9stepsawesome) & composability spanning multiple requests using **Workflows** & **Integrations**.
