# System:
**1. A system is a whole that is defined by its function(s) in one or more containing systems.** <br>
**2. Every system contains at least two essential parts and these must satisfy three conditions.**
  * Every essential part of a system can affect its behavior or properties.
  * The way an essential part affects the properties or behavior of the whole depends on the
   state or activity of at least one other part of the system.
  * Groups of essential parts, subsystems, also can affect the behavior and properties of the whole system and none has an independent effect on it.

Some important properties of a system derive from its definition.
  * When a system is taken apart it loses its essential properties.
  * No part of a system can carry out the function that defines the system.
  * When a system is taken apart its essential parts lose their ability to carry out the
   function they have in the whole.

Finally: When the performance of any essential part of a system, taken separately, is improved, the performance of the whole may not be.

# Anti-Architecture:
* A [big ball of mud](http://www.laputan.org/mud/) is a software system that lacks a perceivable architecture. Although undesirable from a software engineering point of view, such systems are common in practice due to business pressures, developer turnover and code entropy. They are a type of design anti-pattern.
