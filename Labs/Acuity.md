# Architecture

Build on community learning from design & development to infrastructure & application modernization, leveraging open source, commodity utility technologies & investment made by the [Hyperscalers](https://leadingedgeforum.com/insights/constructing-cloud-native-business-capabilities-if-you-think-cloud-is-only-about-it-infrastructure-you-seriously-need-to-think-again/) in cloud-native applications and business capabilities.

## Steering Changes - CRAWL, WALK & RUN

## Technology Platform

**Application modernization** - developing & deploying containerized applications on Kubernetes & “Infrastructure as Code”. This provides ways of provisioning infrastructure resources in the cloud, and a technology stack for applications through code and automation. This is an enablement to standardize and automate software delivery process, as well as improve collaboration across several teams.

## Principles

Source: [Architecture Principles (draft)](https://ruthmalan.com/ByTopic/architecture/202102ArchitecturePrinciples.pdf)

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

* **Do it Right**
	
  * Adds Business Value - Understand business goals and ensures work adds right value
  * Delivers with Quality and Agility
	
* **Elevate**
		
  * Challenges and Influences
  * Builds Trust

* **Always Innovate**
		
  * Offers Vision - Articulates big picture 
  * Takes Risks

* **Lead**
		
  * Raises the bar
  * Develops talent in others
  * Innovates to accelerate

* **People Leadership**

  * Coaches and develops 
  * Attracts and Hires top talent

* **Inspires and Empowers**

## Helm

Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes and helps users define, manage, install, upgrade, and rollback even the most complex Kubernetes application. Helm uses a package format called [Charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) to describe a set of Kubernetes resources. The Helm Chart contains the resources described in the following table.
| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Chart.yaml | Information about the chart. |
| values.yaml | Default configuration for the chart. |
| templates | Templates that combine with values to generate the Kubernetes manifest files. |
| --set, --values | additional values provided at deployment time which override values.yaml settings |

Refer to the guide on [Using Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/) for an explanation of useful Helm concepts.

The repo for the helm charts may look something like this:

```
$ tree -a charts/

charts/
└── My App
    ├── .helmignore
    ├── Chart.yaml
    ├── charts
    ├── templates
    │   ├── NOTES.txt
    │   ├── _helpers.tpl
    │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   ├── ingress.yaml
    │   ├── service.yaml
    │   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
    │   └── tests
    │       └── test-connection.yaml
    └── values.yaml
```

See [helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for command documentation.

### Create Chart
```
$ helm create
```

See helm [create](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_create/) for command documentation.

### Install Chart
```
$ helm install 
```

See helm [install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation.

### Dependencies
```
$ helm dependency
```

See helm [dependency](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency/) for command documentation.

### Uninstall Chart
```
$ helm uninstall
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

See helm [uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation.

### Upgrading Chart
```
$ helm upgrade --install
```

See helm [upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation.
